                                    While AirCover for Hosts protects you while you are hosting an Airbnb stay or
                                    Experience, it is not a substitute for personal insurance. You may also be required
                                    by law to maintain certain auto insurance, which would not be satisfied by AirCover
                                    for Hosts. Since everyone situation is different, you should talk to your insurer
                                    to see how or if your policy overlaps with AirCover for Hosts.

                                    As a host, you can choose a cancellation policy for your listing. If a guest
                                    cancels, you'll follow the policy you've selected. Be sure to communicate with the
                                    guest and Airbnb's support team as needed to resolve the cancellation.
